# WebScrapping A Crypto Website Wth Python
In this project I automated the pull of data every 5 minutes from a crypto website using their public API, I performed some cleaning on the data and visualised a couple of insights.

This is a very interesting project as the website already has a documentation on how to use their API to access data on their website.
