# WebScrapping A Crypto Website With Python
In this project I automated the pull of data every 5 minutes from a crypto website using their public API, I performed some cleaning on the data and visualised a couple of insights.

This is a very interesting project as the crypto company already had documentation on how to use their API to access data on their website.

# Webscrapping Wikipedia Data With Python
For this project, I continued to demonstrate my skills in scrapping data from real websites, this time from Wikipedia to get the data on the list of the largest companies in the United States by revenue. 

I extracted the data and saved it first as a dataframe and iterated over the dataframe to save it into a CSV.
